> **The local-first control plane for long-horizon coding agents.**
> AIOS gives your AI coding agent what it's missing — cross-session project memory, multi-agent teams, resumable overnight runs, and verifiable evidence for every change. **One sentence. Any complex task. Done.**

**It runs on top of the agent you already use** — Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Hermes, and Grok. AIOS is not another agent framework: your agent stays exactly as it is, and AIOS adds the memory, coordination, and verification layer around it. Everything runs locally.

## Why AIOS

Your AI coding agent is smart — but it forgets everything between sessions, can't coordinate multi-step work on its own, and has no way to verify its own output. Long-horizon work (big refactors, release handoffs, overnight runs) falls apart exactly where the single-session agent ends. AIOS fixes that:

| You say | AIOS does |
| —- | --- |
| "Refactor the auth module" | Remembers last week's decisions, picks the right approach, makes the change, and verifies it works |
| "Review this PR and update tests" | Splits the work across parallel agents, keeps coupled changes in order, collects evidence |
| "Finish the release handoff overnight" | Runs the full objective with checkpoints, resumes if interrupted, delivers verified results |
| "Fix the login bug" | Recalls relevant context, routes to the simplest fix path, checks the fix before showing you |

**Your data stays local.** Everything — memory, logs, verification evidence — runs on your machine. Nothing leaves.

**You don't change how you work.** Keep using the coding client you already have. AIOS adds the control plane it's missing.

## Install in 30 seconds

macOS / Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rexleimo/aios/releases/latest/download/aios-install.sh | bash
source ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
aios init --all
aios doctor --native --verbose
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
irm https://github.com/rexleimo/aios/releases/latest/download/aios-install.ps1 | iex
. $PROFILE
aios init --all
aios doctor --native --verbose
```

Run these from a **project root** when you want project-level guidance and memory.

Unattended install:

```bash
node scripts/aios.mjs init --all --yes-compression-tools --yes-headroom-mcp
```

**You're ready when:**

- `aios doctor --native --verbose` reports your client detected and synced
- `.aios/context-db/index.json` exists in your project root
- `aios memo search "anything"` answers without an error

## Proof, not promises

Agent claims are cheap, so AIOS is built so you never have to trust one:

- **Every run leaves evidence.** Harness runs produce evidence envelopes — commands, exit codes, hashes, test output — written under `.aios/`, not spoken assurances. See [Solo Harness](https://cli.rexai.top/solo-harness/).
- **The project verifies itself.** Every release passes the script test suite plus strict `typecheck && test && build` gates, and the [changelog](https://cli.rexai.top/changelog/) records what changed and why.
- **Your install is inspectable.** `aios doctor --native --verbose` reports exactly what was detected, synced, or skipped. No silent side effects.
- **Memory is inspectable.** ContextDB is pull-based and local: search what the agent remembers with `aios memo search`, and nothing leaves your machine.

AIOS is maintained in the open by [Rex](https://rexai.top) — see the release history for a steady cadence of shipped, verified changes.

## How it fits together

```text
Your coding client (codex / claude / gemini / opencode / hermes / grok)
        │
        ▼
  AIOS guidance + Workflow Policy
        │
        ├── ContextDB   local project memory (pull-based)
        ├── rex-harness software control plane (Fact → Capability → Evidence)
        ├── Team / Solo long-running or parallel work
        └── Doctor / Privacy / verification evidence
```

![Workflow policy routes](docs-site/assets/visual-workflow-policy.svg)

`rex-harness` is a required planning runtime for AIOS. Release installers already bundle the pinned submodule, so a normal release install does **not** need a second npm package or MCP service. From source:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rexleimo/aios.git
```

If the clone skipped submodules, `aios init` / `aios setup` will try `git submodule update --init --recursive -- rex-harness` and stop with a clear fix if recovery fails.

Rex is the default workflow for new installs. Superpowers is retired as an AIOS workflow component. See the [Rex Workflow Migration](https://cli.rexai.top/superpowers/) guide.

## Quick tour

```bash
# Initialize project marker + detected client guidance
aios init --all

# Inspect install, native client sync, safety checks
aios doctor --native --verbose

# Save and search a durable project decision
aios memo add "Keep authentication tests strict"
aios memo search "authentication"

# Parallel work or a resumable objective
aios work "Review the auth module and update its tests"
aios team 3:codex "Review the auth module and update its tests"
aios harness run --objective "Finish the release handoff" --worktree

# Preview adaptive routing without creating a live plan
aios plan auto-gate --task "Refactor the auth module" --dry-run --json
```

The project marker points clients at `.aios/context-db/index.json`. ContextDB is **pull-based**: agents search or recall relevant material instead of receiving the whole history on every prompt.

## Supported clients

Native or compatibility integrations for six coding clients — same project memory, same workflow policy, same verification evidence everywhere:

`codex` · `claude` · `gemini` · `opencode` · `hermes` · `grok` (Grok Build)

Feature depth varies by client. Run `aios doctor --native --verbose` instead of assuming every route exists everywhere.
